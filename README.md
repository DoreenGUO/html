# HTML
This repositery is to documenting my process of learning HTML.
 
It is created at the end of my first year of PhD. Always being axious and stressful, I realized that it's better to learn something to improve myself.
Sometimes I feel really down because I think it is too late to start to learn these 'basic' knowledge in PhD. But there's no better choice given that I don't have a time machine.

I am trying to make this funny and record my daily. Hope this could be a antidote of the anxiety.
